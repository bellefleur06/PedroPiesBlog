                <h5>Anime Review, Jan 31, 2023</h5>
                <img src="https://images5.alphacoders.com/596/596534.jpg" class="fakeimg" style="height:100%;">
                <p>"Terror in Resonance" is quite an exception in the anime world, as it is one of the very few
                    occasions (I must admit, I am unaware of any other similar case) where a series is not based on a
                    manga, but rather on the imagination of four scriptwriters (Kenta Ihara, Jun Kumagai, Hiroshi Seko,
                    Shoten Yano). Furthermore, and especially because of the direction of Shinichiro Watanabe, whose
                    previous work includes "Cowboy Bepop" and "Samurai Champloo," "Terror in Resonance" is a truly great
                    title. But first, let's start from the beginning.</p>
                <img src="https://images8.alphacoders.com/596/596536.jpg" class="fakeimg" style="height:100%;">
                <p>In an alternate version of the present, Tokyo has been the victim of a truly devastating terrorist
                    attack that has left its imprint on all aspects of society. When a nuclear weapon is stolen from a
                    secret military base and soon after, an attack is launched by two strange individuals who have
                    accepted responsibility by posting a video on the internet, the entire government mechanism goes
                    into meltdown. Soon after, a task force led by Kurahashi is formed with the mission of solving the
                    mysteries left by the two perpetrators, but it is Kenjiro Shibazaki, an ex-detective demoted to the
                    records division, who has the most success in doing so. As we learn more about the two "terrorists,"
                    Nine and Twelve, another agenda emerges, while Lisa Mishima, a student, accidentally becomes
                    involved with them, and Five, an FBI agent, takes over the investigation.</p>
                <img src="https://images5.alphacoders.com/745/745757.png" class="fakeimg" style="height:100%;">
                <p>Shinichiro Watanabe directs a film that excels in both story and narrative. Using the Hiroshima
                    bombing and the 9/11 incident as a springboard, Watanabe has crafted a complex case rich in
                    sociopolitical commentary. In that regard, the series addresses family and friendship, professional
                    relationships and the concept of duty, terrorism, public opinion and the formation of popularity,
                    corruption, the one-sided relationship between the Japanese and the US government, and eugenics, as
                    well as subtle elements of romance.</p>
                <iframe class="fakeimg" height="800" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aiZrjeZvF8Y?feature=oembed">
                </iframe>
                <p>The element that stands out, however, is the crime-solving aspect, with both the riddles and their
                    solutions highlighting the scriptwriters' intelligence and knowledge while forming one of the better
                    axes of the story. This element, along with the great narrative that unfolds the various layers of
                    the story in a truly elaborate manner, are the main reasons for the sense of agony that pervades the
                    series and is carried all the way until the great, and quite heartbreaking, finale. Yoko Kanno's
                    exceptional music heightens the above sense while emphasizing the "calmer" moments.</p>
                <p>Mappa's animation is also excellent, fitting in perfectly with the title's aesthetics, which follow a
                    realistic path for the most part, though the various action scenes and explosions are truly
                    impressive. The colors are mostly in grey and dark tones, which gives the anime a noir feel. Another
                    distinguishing feature of the production is Nakazawa Kazuto's character design, with him creating a
                    number of distinct characters, the majority of which have western facial characteristics.</p>

                    excellent direction, and stunning visuals.</p>
